# Security Overview

## 🔐 Current Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ **JWT-based authentication** with httpOnly cookies
- ✅ **Password hashing** using bcrypt with salt rounds 12
- ✅ **Route protection** via middleware
- ✅ **Automatic token verification** and refresh
- ✅ **Secure cookie settings** (httpOnly, secure in production, sameSite)

### Data Protection
- ✅ **Field-level encryption** for sensitive data (AES-256-CBC)
- ✅ **User data encryption** (names, emails stored encrypted)
- ✅ **Project/Task/Goal data encryption** 
- ✅ **Environment variable protection** for encryption keys

### Password Security
- ✅ **Minimum 6 characters** requirement
- ✅ **Complexity requirements**: uppercase, lowercase, numbers
- ✅ **Real-time password strength indicator**
- ✅ **Client and server-side validation**
- ✅ **Input sanitization** to prevent XSS

### API Security
- ✅ **Input validation** on all endpoints
- ✅ **Error handling** without information leakage
- ✅ **CORS protection** via Next.js defaults
- ✅ **SQL injection prevention** via Prisma ORM

### Infrastructure Security
- ✅ **Environment variables** for secrets
- ✅ **Database connection security** 
- ✅ **HTTPS enforcement** in production
- ✅ **Secure headers** via Next.js

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Environment Variables Required
```
DATABASE_URL=          # PostgreSQL connection
JWT_SECRET=           # JWT signing secret (32+ chars)
ENCRYPT_KEY=          # AES encryption key (32+ chars)
NODE_ENV=production   # For production security settings
```

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 6 characters
- At least 1 uppercase letter
- At least 1 lowercase letter  
- At least 1 number

### Encryption Details
- Algorithm: AES-256-CBC
- Key derivation: SHA-256 hash of ENCRYPT_KEY
- Random IV for each encryption
- Format: `iv:encryptedData`

## 🚀 Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights
3. **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data stored
4. **Secure by Default**: Secure configurations out of the box
5. **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
6. **Error Handling**: Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
